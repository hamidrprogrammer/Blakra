- Wf-Team Members: Marrallisa

Dealing with procastinationAs an entrepreneur, staying motivated and organised can be a real challenge. With over 10 years of entrepreneurial knowledge, Marrallisa Kreijkes has also known what this immense pressure can do. Being an entrepreneur is like having a relationship. Your performance in your business directly mirrors the quality and organisation of your personal life. When life gets you down or run into multiple disappointments, you tend to just keep on going. At the time of procastionation, you tend to not realise there is a reason your body is ‘pulling the emergency brake’. So on top of already having too much going on,you tend to beat yourself up over being lazy, overindulging in behaviours like netflix binging, buying and overeating junk food and scrolling on social media. The worst part is: You dont even like enjoy giving in to all your ‘desires’ it at the time. You just feel some constant, bugging undertone of restlessness because you know you can do so much better. Why was i so much productiver earlier in the week?
